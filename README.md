# Stealthbay

Stealthbay is a **portfolio project** exploring the technical foundations of an anonymous online marketplace architecture, focusing on **privacy, decentralization concepts, and crypto-based payments** — implemented for **educational and research purposes only**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how privacy-focused systems *could* be designed using modern cryptography, backend logic, and secure communication principles, while remaining accessible via a normal website interface.

**Stealthbay does NOT host real transactions or illegal content.**  
It exists purely as a **technical showcase**.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Anonymous-style user architecture (conceptual)
- Crypto-based payment flow simulation
- Separation of frontend access and backend logic
- Security-first design thinking
- Privacy-aware system modeling

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:**  
  - C++ (core logic / performance-critical components)  
  - Python (backend services, automation, prototypes)

- **Tools:**  
  - Git & GitHub  
  - Linux-based development environment

## 📦 Installation (Development)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaa-bad/Stealthbay.git
cd Stealthbay
